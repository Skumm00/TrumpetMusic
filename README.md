How to Use: Just download or clone the repo and open it in a text editor like VS CODE. Then run the program and it should work. 

About: In this program, you can use it to quickly convert Sheet Music Note Names into trumpet fingerings. I belive this is very useful for me as when I'm reading sheet music and dont know how to play a note, I can enter it and get the fingering. A fingering is a set of numbers which are 3 digits in total because the trumpet has 3 valves(so 3 digits). An example could be 12 which is the first and second valve pressed together which plays the note E. This project was kind of hard to make but good for helping with my coding and music skills a bit at the same time

Extra Details: I tried using json but I didnt use it, and for other libraries I used logging and difflib and other as well
